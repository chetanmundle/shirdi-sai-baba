        The extracts in this anthology are taken from Shri Sat Charitra. They comprise part of Chapters in which the author, Shri Govind Raghunath Dabolkar alias Hemadpant refers to Saibaba his devotees and vision.

      <h2 className="history-title01">Shri Sai Baba</h2>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        Shri Sai Baba is revered as one of the greatest saints ever seen in India, endowed with unprecedented powers, and is worshipped as a God incarnate. (SAI meaning Sakshaat Ishwar) - GOD THE ABSOLUTE
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        This mysterious Fakir first made his appearance in Shirdi as a youth and remained there throughout his long life. HE transformed the lives of those who met him and continuously is doing so even after his Samadhi in 1918 for those whose hearts are touched by his love and who pray and call him at any emergency in life for his blessings.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        Baba stated that his mission is to “Give Blessings” without discrimination to all, and he proves it in myriad ways by healing the sick, saving lives, protecting the vulnerable, averting accidents, granting offspring, facilitating financial gain, bringing people into harmony within themselves and with each other and, above all, in effecting the spiritual evolution and transformation of those who came to him as the last resort.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        Baba is, as one of his contemporary devotees put it, “The embodiment of the Supreme Spirit lighting the sadhaka's (seekers') path by His every word and action”.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        To his devotees, Baba is nothing less than a GOD. This has been a matter of experience and not imaginary.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="history-quote01">
        “I look at all with an equal eye”
      </blockquote>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        An outstanding aspect of Sai Baba is that he is beyond distinctions of religion, caste or creed. He embodied all religions and preached the Universal religion of Love.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        Devotees of all faiths find their meeting point in the Sai and people from all communities and all walks of life are united by the great love and reverence Baba inspires in them. Baba had great regard for his Hindu devotees and their Gurus and he responded to their needs and permitted worship according to the Hindu and other religious rituals. At the same time his dwelling place was a Masjid (Mosque) and the name of Allah was ever on his lips. HE described himself as in Service to GOD (ALLAH) and as a soul ever remembering ALLAH -(YAD - A - HAKKA)
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        People today flock Shirdi in ever-increasing numbers to pay homage to the Divine and to experience the truth of Baba’s promise that He would be active in answering devotees' prayers even from his tomb. Like Ten Commandments BABA has given eleven assurances to humanity for welfare.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        Baba said that he was a slave in the service of those who loved him that he was ever living to help those who turn to him and that he has to take care of his children day and night. He then taught the values of total surrender to the Almighty Master (ALLAH MALIK EK- The only ONE) and experience his grace.
      </p>
      <p className="history-paragraph01">
        In coming to Baba’s Shirdi His children experience the truth how BABA unfailingly fulfil his commitments to his devotees by coming to their rescue in times of crisis.
